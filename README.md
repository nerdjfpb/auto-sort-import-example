# Prettier Auto sort example

It's a tutorial for prettier auto sort imports. Pretty handy tool to use.

Find out more on the blog link - https://blog.nerdjfpb.com/how-to-auto-sort-imports-in-frontend-example-with-typescript-nextjs/

## How to run

I created two branches for the example to play with

- `main` branch (contain the code without auto sort)
- `prettier-applied` branch (contain the code with the sort and configure applied)

you can also check the diff between two branches - https://github.com/nerdjfpb/auto-sort-import-example/pull/1/files
